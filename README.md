# TopicTools
A lightweight framework for developing powerful command-line tools with XQuery. The ttools framework enables you to write XQuery programs which are topic tools. The term “topic tool” summarizes a simple idea: a tool which offers various operations related to a particular topic. Reserving the term for command-line tools, the idea can be evolved into a generic model of invocation syntax and basic behavioural rules. A conformant topic tool can accomplish many different tasks and is easy to use. Using the ttools framework, topic tools are also easy to write. ttools thus promises benefits to both, the tool user and the tool developer.

Maintenance of topic tools requires the use of the BaseX processor ( http://basex.org ). The topic tools themselves can be used with any standards conformant XQuery processor offering a command-line interface, as for example the Saxon processor ( http://www.saxonica.com ).

Source code and documentation will be added soon to this site, namely before February 13, the start of the conference xmlprague 2015 (http://xmlprague.cz).
